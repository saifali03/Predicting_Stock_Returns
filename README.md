# Using Machine Learning Models to Predict Stock Returns for Apple Inc.

This repository contains the code and report for our project **Using Machine Learning Models to Predict Stock Returns for Apple Inc**. The project aims to predict whether a stock will have a positive or negative return in the next quarter, leveraging quarterly stock data, company-relevant features, and economic indicators from 2009 to 2024.  

## Files in this Repository  

- **main.ipynb**  
  This Jupyter Notebook contains the implementation of the machine learning models used in the project, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and comparison. The notebook also includes visualizations and calibration curves for the models.  

- **Project_Report.pdf**  
  A detailed project report summarizing the methodology, results, and insights. It includes the analysis of different machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, XGBoost, and Neural Networks), their performance metrics, and the comparison against a Random Walk benchmark.  

## Highlights  
- Comprehensive feature engineering to improve model performance.  
- Comparison of machine learning models in terms of precision, recall, and accuracy.  
- Baseline comparison with a Random Walk model to evaluate effectiveness.  
- XGBoost demonstrated the best performance, achieving a precision of ~80% and recall of ~90%.
